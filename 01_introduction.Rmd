## PURPOSE

The purpose of this document is to provide an 'Outlook' of expected abundance of salmon in 2025 to inform the harvest planning process.

The Outlook provides either an expected abundance for those stocks with statistical forecasts or a categorical abundance expectation based expert opinion.

## OUTLOOK FORMAT

The Outlook document contains:

1.  CU groupings with stock management units (SMUs) to better inform decision-making consistent with Fishery Act and IFMP requirements.
2.  SMUs with statistical forecasts, which are consolidated and reported in the Outlook Document.
3.  SMUs without statistical forecasts, have a standardized interpretation of SMU status in relation to outlook categories.
4.  Information on SMU biological benchmarks and management references (where defined) for additional context.

## BACKGROUND

### Stock Management Units

For the 2025 Outlook, 'Stock Management Units' (SMUs) are used to describe stock aggregates that inform development of Integrated Fisheries Management Plans (IFMPs) for salmon. This is required for implementation of the fisheries-related revisions to the *Fishery Act*.

For salmon, the working definition of a 'stock management unit' (SMU) is a 'group of one or more conservation units (CUs) that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status', meaning harvest control rules would apply to the aggregate, at least in a coarse sense. Use of SMUs does not preclude considerations related to conserving CU-level diversity, but rather is a practical aggregation of CUs for harvest planning and reporting purposes. That is, it is the scale at which harvest management plans, or better, management and assessment procedures, are developed in Integrated Fisheries Management Plans (IFMPs). In many cases, elements of the Precautionary Approach are implemented at finer scales of organization within a SMU.

### Biological and Management References

The purpose of a stock forecast or outlook is to provide information to harvest managers to potentially adjust harvest plans according to the expected stock abundance. Ideally in that regard, the status of the stock management unit (or sub-unit) is assessed against specified limits and targets and pre-defined harvest strategies (or harvest control rules) are in place that define the actions required to meet targets and avoid limits.

Therefore, where biological benchmarks and/or limit reference points are defined for CUs or SMUs, respectively, they are noted in the Outlook/Forecast tables below. Similarly, if management targets are in place they are identified. Lack of these references is a gap and work is on-going to develop methods and complete the analyses to define these references. The summary below describes how these biological and management references are applied and interpreted.

### WSP Lower Biological Benchmarks and Limit Reference Points (LRPs)

For implementation of the Wild Salmon Policy, the status of salmon Conservation Units (CU) is assessed against 'biological benchmarks'. The lower biological benchmark allows for substantial buffer between it and the level of abundance at which the stock would be considered at risk of extinction and is generally estimated as S~GEN~. The upper biological benchmark delineates the 'amber' from 'green' WSP status zone and is generally estimated as .80 S~MSY~. For more data-limited systems (i.e. where it is not possible to numerically estimate stock-recruit parameters), proxies for lower and upper biological benchmarks may be applied. For example, the lower and upper biological benchmarks are estimated as .25 and .60 percentiles of the long-term observed spawning abundance.

```{r benchmarks, out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "Benchmarks and biological status zones for CU assessments.", echo=F}

```

Under DFO’s Precautionary Approach (PA), the stock management unit (SMU) limit reference point (LRP) is a biologically defined reference that delineates the ‘critical zone’ from the ‘cautious zone’ for harvest management.  It represents the status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock. There may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-term loss of harvest opportunities.

```{r precautionary, out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "Schematic of a generalized harvest strategy under DFO’s PA.", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("data/precautionaryApproach.png")
```

Given the intent is similar between the WSP and DFO’s PA, it is practical to equate the SMU LRPs with lower biological benchmarks at the CU level. However, the WSP recognizes that serious harm to species occurs when CUs are depleted or lost.  Therefore, to be consistent with the WSP, LRPs at the SMU scale should consider CU-scale biodiversity.  Methodological approaches for defining LRPs are being developed to ensure CU-level biodiversity is considered and for both data-rich and data-limited assessment systems.   

### Management Targets and Operational Control Points

While management targets or operational control points are often informed by biological benchmarks and stock-recruit reference points, they also consider other objectives such as maximizing sustainable harvest, avoiding over-fishing, maintaining stable access and opportunity, allocation objectives such as how catch is distributed among harvesters, etc.  As such, they are tightly linked to the harvest strategy and fishery management measures.  

In some cases, the management target may be a simple trigger such as when a ‘surplus-to-escapement-target’ harvest control rule is in place.  In other cases, there may be multiple management targets (or operational control points) used to adjust the harvest control rule at different levels of abundance.   

Note that an SMU can be below its management target (and therefore subject to some level of harvest restriction as per the harvest control strategy), but well above levels that represent a serious conservation concern (i.e. the LRP or LBB).  In other situations, an SMU may be well above its target but subject to harvest restrictions because the stock rears or co-migrates in mixed-stock fishing areas with other SMUs (or CUs) that are near or below their LRP (or LBB).

## Stock Outlooks

### Categorical Stock Outlooks

For the ‘Preliminary Outlook’ and for those SMUs for which statistical forecasts are not produced, either because the SMU is not intensively managed and/or is more data limited, categorical ‘outlooks’ are assigned.  These outlooks are based on expert opinion qualified with information from monitoring programs.  For each stock grouping an outlook of expected spawning abundance is assigned based on a scale of 1 to 4.

For CUs or SMUs with references in place (i.e. either lower (LBB) and upper biological benchmarks (UBB) and/or lower reference points (LRP) and upper stock references (USR) and Target Reference Point (TRP), these references are used to assign Outlook category.  For more data-limited CUs or SMUs (i.e. those without defined stock or management references), expected spawning abundance is compared to average or median abundance based on available information.

SMUs for which insufficient data area available to determine an Outlook are noted as ‘Data Deficient’.
