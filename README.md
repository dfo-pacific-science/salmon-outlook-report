# Salmon Outlook Report

**Note:** This repository is a work in progress. Instructions and code may change as development continues.

## Overview
The Salmon Outlook is an annual process that provides categorical and numeric estimates of salmon abundance for the upcoming year by Stock Management Unit (SMU) and/or Conservation Unit (CU). These estimates help inform harvest planning decisions.

This repository contains R code and supporting files designed to modernize the data flow for Salmon Outlooks by:
- Streamlining data collection (e.g., using surveys)
- Improving final products (e.g., reorganized tables based on new Crosswalk data, more visually engaging presentations)
- Automating parts of the process to reduce manual work

---

## Features
The code in this repository supports:
1. Semi-automated presentations tailored for different audiences (executives, fisheries managers, external teams)
2. Automated report generation using R Markdown, based on the technical report format from the `csasdown` R package

---

## Data
- Input data comes from Survey123 and is stored in the `data/` folder (currently `Test3.xlsx`).
- Replace this test file with actual survey results when available.
- For scripts to run correctly, the Excel file should include three sheets:
    - `Salmon_Outlook_Report`: Outlooks + related info for SMUs
    - `cu_outlook_records`: Outlooks + related info for CUs
    - `other_records`: Outlooks + related info for hatchery & indicator stocks

## How to Use

### Generate the Report
1. Open `Index.Rmd` in RStudio.
2. Click **Knit** to create the report.
   - Tables are generated by `statusTables.R` in the `data/` folder.
   - Update this script to point to the correct data file.

### Create the PowerPoint
1. Open `powerPointTables.R` in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the script to:
   - Add tables and maps from the data file
   - Insert them into the template PowerPoint (`draftPrelimPres.pptx`)
   - Save the new file as `updated_presentation.pptx`

## Additional Notes
- Connect RStudio to this GitHub repository. If you’re unfamiliar with the process, see this [UC Davis Git/GitHub Guide](https://ucd-r-davis.github.io/R-DAVIS/setting_up_git.html).
- You may also need instructions from the `csasdown` package. See instructions Initial Setup instructions in the [csasdown guide](https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown/tree/main).
